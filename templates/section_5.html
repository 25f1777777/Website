        Adanthaaa choodalaaa anii chiraku padaku. No need to see at the concepts.
        
        But just have a look at questions and think in ur mind, elaa cheste ostadaa anii. If u have a doubt, or feel like u r seeing this kind of question for first time, then try doing it. Everytime no need to have pen and paper, but <span class="highlight">use ur phone as a book</span> and make use of it.
        
        If u think, ee kind of question already chesam or edii almost same laane undi with small difference, edoo oka small step or number maariste chaalu (just like how u caught about the divide work by C as he is available only once for 3 days, and later on it's normal problem), alantivi just catch the logic and skip that question.

    <div class="content-para">
        Entha process enduku raaa ani adagakuu, it's simple bcs, it is a way of training you to competitive exams. Eppudaina choodu baaga chadivevallu question choosi edii raadu ani annaru antee, adii pedda rod question or still more anii.
        
        Bcs they get acquainted by looking at various questions and identifying the difficulty of the question. Exam lo niku kanipichee anni questions cheskuntuu untaa ante pani avvadu assalu. <span class="highlight">U need to know how to pick the easy questions.</span> And aaa picking process ravali ante, u need practise a lot.

        Practise doesn't mean that pen paper pattukoni కవితలు raayadam (where brain doesn't work for that question), but it actually means that, facing more number of questions, getting familiarised with more variability of asking questions.
        
        And nuv 100 questions solve cheyyu. If u didn't find a pattern, then exam lo hole eee. I have seen many people, like dattatreya, u and few more. They work hard, for a more time, but exam lo anni marchipotam or time saripoledu these kind of reasons estaruu.

        Here I'm not judging you, but marchipotunnav antee, these mathematical or physics stuff, u haven't learnt them in correct way at ur foundation ani, i know mana clg alaa undii, we can't do anything. And time saripolee antee, it could be bcs of main reason is, u have spent more time on difficult questions which is not needed to be solved. Again deeni gurinchi inko roju manchigaa discuss cheddam.
