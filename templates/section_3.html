                <p>Chooduu</p>

                <p>Once u only imagine</p>

                <p>You are a boy who is brought up in a lower middle class family in ur childhood</p>

                <p>Who used to change schools regularly bcs of increased fee from one school to other , bcs of bad friendships , bcs of being debarbed from school , bcs of not paying fee for 2 months</p>

                <p>Who used to stay alone in home with a dvd player with only 2 movies , and watching them , living in ur dream life daily</p>

                <p>You used to go to school just to make some timepass but nothing else</p>

                <p>And , who was bullied by whole class bcs of u eating ur lunch with ur mom's hand even in ur 3rd class</p>

                <p>You had misconception between love and lust , and who ran behind many girls just to have some hug or romance , and all those girls used to leave u even within a week</p>

                <p>And u being an innocent , started to flat another fresh girl</p>

                <p>And after ur 3rd class , u realised this lust is not good , and decided not to talk with any girls</p>

                <p>And started a gang , where u r the gangster 😎</p>

                <p>Who used to make even the seniours fear 😨 😟 😱</p>

                <p>And u slowly understood , all ur teammates are just using u up ,bcs whenever your team was caught , u r the only one who used to get scoldings from teachers and complaints to parents</p>

                <p>Then u decided , all frds are only temporary</p>

                <p>Just live ur life happily without love and frds</p>

                <p>See the way of thinking if that boy in his 4th class</p>

                <p>And all after this , u came to ur new school</p>

                <p>And ur family came from lower middle class lo medium middle class</p>

                <p>And u were stabilised in a single school from ur 5th class</p>

                <p>U had both enjoyment and some unhappy moments in ur 5th class ( small issues with frds )</p>

                <p>And life just continued like that</p>

                <p>In ur 6th class , u used to have a frd group ( offline group , not a whatsapp grp or others ) , who decided they'll stay till end together</p>

                <p>Which later became true within few yrs</p>

                <p>And u again felt broken</p>

                <p>Later , some girls started showing they have crush on you</p>

                <p>Firstly , u felt very happy , but realised , it's not the time , then u wanted to confirm with them verbally , that's when they said noo , nothing like that</p>

                <p>Later u used to study well , then comes lockdown</p>

                <p>U don't have mobile numbers of any of ur frds , or u don't have any school groups</p>

                <p>Ofc u got mobile numbers from ur classmates in zoom class chat ( boys numbers only )</p>

                <p>And in ur 10th class , u got a bit connected to a girl , who also used to treat u well</p>

                <p>But , after 10th class , it's like , u both become strangers , ofc u met sometimes after ur 10th , tried a lot to meet her , to talk to her , to get her mobile number , but always ignored , and blocked too in whatsapp</p>

                <p>( u met her during ur inter public exams )</p>

                <p>Then , u decided some qualities that must and should be there in ur wife :</p>

                <div class="qualities-box">
                    <ol>
                        <li>She should talk to me freely , openly</li>
                        <li>She shouldn't hide anything from me</li>
                        <li>She shouldn't lie to me</li>
                        <li>She should approach me as the first choice in any aspect</li>
                        <li>I should be the first priority to her</li>
                        <li>She should understand my situation</li>
                        <li>She should treat me the same even when I'm rich or poor , good or bad , top or avg , helping or not helping in any aspect</li>
                        <li>She should be loyal to me</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <p>During this time , u know I'm in ur class only</p>

                <p>Nen evaritho maatladina mana JL mam used to scold them , and everyone used to say to u that naa pakkana nuv kurchoku raa baabu, vere daggara kurcho anni</p>

                <p>Everyone wants ur phone number for doubt clarification, everyone wants ur tips , but no one actually wants u</p>

                <p>U felt , one girl as a good one , bcs in her u saw ur elder sis in law ( who passed away in ur 10th class only ) , ofc i haven't mentioned about relatives , there are no good relatives except less than 10</p>

                <p>You wanted to have that girl ( <em>mercy</em> ) as a frd for ur lifetime , u kept many efforts , just to speak something with her , u did one thing which changed her a lot ( giving chocolate in book ) , she started ignoring , late replies ( veryyyy late ) , cold replies , which hurted u a lot , but still u want to talk , ur inter is done and joined in ur B.Tech too , and you too in a position of trying to forget her , and do not get that close to any others</p>

                <p>Bcs , everyone will go in one or the other day</p>

                <p>And u came to know that u r not allowed to join in any other clgs , other than AU , and u almost went into depression</p>

                <p>U got many evil thoughts like hardwork is of waste , just chill and enjoy no need to study , it's all waste of time , etc bcs of ur <strong> overthinking </strong></p>

                <p>But , then , a girl came , who used to give quick replies , and all</p>

                <p>Who gave him a hope of life , who gave him a bit of true happiness since last 8 months ( first time in that whole year )</p>

                <p>Who used to speak very frankly , whom u felt u could speak wholeheartedly</p>

                <p>Who used to share each and everything with u , everything including her secret bestie , and many others</p>

                <p>Whenever you talk to her , u felt happy , and felt for the first time , how it feels when care comes from others ( as u used to have only one side care but no much response from others ) . You felt very happy , but , with the recent experience then , he thought not to talk with anyone.</p>

                <p>You thought she is the girl for you , but slowly realised her mood swings , getting attached to anyone easily, being very innocent and sensitive , and many other things</p>

                <p>Slowly , one of the girl who said she have crush on u in school , came back to u and proposed u</p>

                <p>U asked that girl's suggestion what i should do , she said do what u like</p>

                <p>U said everything about ur past , u said all bad about urself , but still , she loved you</p>

                <p>And ur life had a drastic change after her arrival into ur life</p>

                <p>U felt the most luckiest person in the world</p>

                <p>There may be multiple opinions</p>

                <p>But according to you , u just belive that , being loved by ur loved ones gives u 10x more happiness than self love</p>

                <p>And , ur girl used to give that kind of love to you</p>

                <p>U used to teach her many things related to study and others too , u used to meet once in a week at the beginning of ur love , when u used to eat ice creams , etc etc</p>

                <p>The cute smile of that girl while being captured in camera while eating is still alive in the boy's heart and mind . The hard pinch given by the girl is still being felt by the boy , not only by his body , but also by his heart</p>

                <p>They met each other daily in the valentine week , even meet is not possible for the boy . They both used to come in each other's dream as well</p>

                <p>U used to talk to each other late nights , even now too , u used to send msgs to her till midnight even after she slept</p>

                <p>Ofc slowly , she tried to shift her focus onto sem exams and later skills .</p>

                <p>And all of sudden , she decided not to stay with u and wanted to break up</p>

                <p>U r like , whyyy ?? From when ??? Why not we fix it ??? Why not to continue ??? And many more questions</p>

                <p>U cried , asked , requested, questioned , begged her a lot</p>

                <p>U who is simple , living with her in ur dreamworld , cannot digest the decision she took</p>

                <p>U just forget everything and just sat alone and asked ur self , why to get behind her ??</p>

                <p>Then , ur inner self replied with a smile</p>

                <p>" <em>You think u can live without her , but u cannot live without her thoughts</em></p>

                <p><em>You think u can live without her , but that kind of living is nothing more than a moving deadbody</em></p>

                <p><em>You think u can live without her , but without her , there is no you</em>"</p>

                <p>Then You questioned , but what about self respect</p>

                <p>Then inner u replied as</p>

                <p>" In true love , there is nothing called self respect</p>

                <p>And it's not more than ur universe <strong><em>cherry</em></strong>   "</p>

                <p>U decided</p>

                <p>Kuch bhi karke usko na jaanedenaa</p>

                <p>Edokati chesi , tanani vellanivvakundaa aapali</p>

                <p>U kept all ur self respect too aside</p>

                <p>Then , all of a sudden , u realised that u r toxic and not giving her freedom and controlling her , bcs of which she wanted to leave u</p>

                <p>You want to prove u r not toxic but very much possessive</p>

                <p>You want to prove that u r not controlling , but trying to take care of her and urself too</p>

                <p>But there is no way to prove that, and admitted urself as tocic and decided to change</p>

                <p>Then u realised, there is no use of changing now bcs it's become too late</p>

                <p>Even she did many wrong things , even everyone may feel u deserve someone better for ur efforts etc , u still feel , ur heart feels , u want only her</p>

                <p>Others don't know how much value she has for you , ofc , that girl only don't know how much value she has , and she asked why me ?? To him . After all these incidents .</p>

                <p>How can u sayy all of these emotions to her ??</p>

                <p>How can u make her more guilty that she isn't dng much for you ?</p>

                <p>How can u type this long msgs expressing all ur feelings without help of any emoji or any AI tool ??</p>

                <p>How can u make her cry after reading all these ??</p>

                <p>How can u hide ur emotions in this chat for these many days ??</p>

                <p>How can you change urself this much for a normal girl ??</p>

                <p>How can u be this much desperate for her ??</p>

                <p>How can you be this much holding the girl even when u r being only hurt also sometimes ??</p>

                <p>How can u think she needs to share everything with you even when she said clearly that u both are just frds ??</p>

                <p>How can u say u feel sad if u watch her interacting with other boys ??</p>

                <p>How can you say how much u love ur universe ??</p>

                <p>*How can you say why only her ??*</p>

                <p>How can u force her to love you ??</p>

                <p>How can u force her to stay with you ??</p>

                <p>How can u live happily without her ??</p>

                <p>How can u force her to fulfil all ur requirements ??</p>

                <p>How can you disturb her from her ambitions and skill devs , as u help her in many ways in carrer dev , u should also support her right ??</p>

                <p>How can u convey all these to her without she being felt guilty ??</p>

                <p>How can u make urself sad after shoeing this and making her cry ??</p>

                <p>You realised that she calls her bestie , nana , kanna , bangaaram , which she also calls you , but still forgive her and blindly trust her and don't say anything even if u feel bad a lot , hurted a lot , but still didn't say anything bcs ur words can hurt her and eventually break their friendship which makes her sad , which u dont like</p>

                <p>So transferring that sadness, u didn't like it and kept that pain in ur heart even till today</p>

                <p>She wants a princess treatment. Doesn't u want a prince treatment ??</p>

                <p>Ofc , many people say yes , but , in true love , they don't need prince treatment but they even wanna stay as a servant to the other person</p>

                <p><strong> Even , u deserve a prince treatment , still , how can u say that u r ready to be a servant to get ur princess in your life ?? </strong></p>

                <p>You stay loyal to her , you say everything and show every chat with girls to her</p>

                <p>But how do u feel after knowing she has been talking to some other boys , even without u knowing it ??</p>

                <p>See , u got a diamond ️ , and u r wanting her to be pigeon red Ruby ( some high quality of ruby )</p>

                <p>With your past , she is way more than what u deserve , until she's happy with you , u should feel u r the most luckiest one .</p>

                <p>You should be happyyyy bcs u got such pure girl in this generation where cheating is normalised, where dating other even when commited became normal , where maintaining more no. of lovers is used as a flex , where lying is very common , where cheating boyfrd in the name of besties , where open relationship is very common , where girl leaving the boy bcs of his insecurities happens daily , where one tries to use other completely , where one fakes his/her feelings to other just because of their money , dressing , style , etc , where divorce is very common , where killing own husband happened many times just bcs of girl cheating with other boy.</p>

                <p>You should be happy , bcs she is not at all of any of those types.</p>

                <p>She loved you ,</p>

                <p>After knowing all ur insecurities,</p>

                <p>all ur possessiveness,</p>

                <p>all ur bad past ,</p>

                <p>all ur financial status ,</p>

                <p>all ur properties , etc .</p>

                <p>She loves u truly bcs of ur care and efforts</p>

                <p>She loved you genuinely . It's very rare to find such girls in this world. She could be way more than a diamond , if she changes some of her things.</p>

                <p>However, u being a frd of her at present , should not advise or request her regarding this , bcs u have a fear of she feeling sad as she thinks u r trying to control her .</p>

                <p>You always tried to know everything about her , it doesn't mean u r controlling her</p>

                <p>You always says to her not to talk to other boys , not bcs u doubt her , or u r toxic , but it's beacuse u still have a fear of giving more love than u by others , u have a fear of others proposing her , and she not in a position to reject him , just bcs she likes the kind of care from him.</p>

                <p>With all these overthinking, over caring , over talkative , over feeling , with all these kinf of old way of thinking, being toxic , trying to control ur gf , and all , u doesn't deserve her . U deserve someone who is much worse than her .</p>

                <p>But won't u feel happy if u get someone whom u don't deserve only ??</p>

                <p class="final-note">Still u r waiting for that one girl, who has changed u a lot , because of whom u changed ur self a lot , for whom u changed ur objectives and qualities of ur wife</p>
