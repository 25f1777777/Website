    <div class="chapter-subtitle">The Pause She Never Took</div>

    <div class="story-text">

        <p>That question didn’t leave Sahana.</p>

        <p>Why am I hurting myself like this?</p>

        <p>It followed her into ordinary moments. During lectures. On bus rides. While brushing her teeth
        before bed. It didn’t demand an answer — it simply stayed, waiting to be noticed.</p>

        <p>One evening, she came home exhausted.</p>

        <p>Her aunt placed a plate of food beside her without asking anything.</p>

        <p>“You didn’t eat properly today,” she said casually, already turning away.</p>

        <p>Sahana nodded.</p>

        <p>Her phone buzzed.</p>

        <p>A message she had been waiting for all day.</p>

        <p>She looked at the screen.</p>

        <p>Then at the plate.</p>

        <p>For a moment, she didn’t pick up the phone.</p>

        <p>Something inside her felt tired — not sad, not angry — just tired.</p>

        <p>For the first time, she didn’t rush to silence her thoughts.</p>

        <p>She paused.</p>

        <p>And in that pause, she started seeing patterns she had ignored for a long time.</p>

        <p>She noticed how her mood depended on certain people’s responses. How a single interaction
        could decide whether her day felt light or heavy. How she waited — quietly, endlessly — for
        reassurance she never asked for.</p>

        <p>She began realizing something uncomfortable.</p>

        <p>She wasn’t just overthinking situations.</p>

        <p>She was building expectations around them.</p>

        <p>Expectations she never spoke about.</p>

        <p>Expectations others never agreed to.</p>

        <p>This didn’t make her angry.</p>

        <p>It made her tired.</p>

        <p>She looked back at recent days and saw how much energy she had spent replaying conversations,
        imagining different reactions, hoping for responses that never came. She saw how often she
        ignored her own exhaustion just to hold on to emotional hope.</p>

        <p>Hope that someone would notice.</p>

        <p>Hope that someone would change.</p>

        <p>And slowly, she questioned that hope.</p>

        <p>Not with bitterness.</p>

        <p>But with honesty.</p>

        <p>She started asking herself small, quiet questions.</p>

        <p>Did they promise me this?</p>

        <p>Or did I expect it because I needed it?</p>

        <p>The answers weren’t easy.</p>

        <p>Some days, she slipped back into old habits. She still overthought. Still felt disappointed. Still
        waited longer than she should have. Change didn’t arrive instantly.</p>

        <p>But something had shifted.</p>

        <p>She no longer blamed herself entirely.</p>

        <p>And she no longer blamed others either.</p>

        <p>She began understanding that pain doesn’t always come from cruelty. Sometimes, it comes
        from expecting things from people who were never meant to give them.</p>

        <p>This realization didn’t bring relief yet.</p>

        <p>It brought clarity.</p>

        <p>And clarity, she would soon learn, is often the most uncomfortable stage — because once you
        see something clearly, you can’t unsee it.</p>

        <p>Sahana wasn’t at peace yet.</p>

        <p>But she had stopped running from the truth.</p>

        <p>And that was the beginning.</p>

        <hr style="margin:50px 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #eee;">

        <h2 class="chapter-title">CHAPTER 6 – PART II</h2>
        <div class="chapter-subtitle">Learning Where to Stop</div>

        <p>Clarity changed the way Sahana looked at things.</p>

        <p>Not immediately.</p>

        <p>Not completely.</p>

        <p>But enough to make her pause before reacting.</p>

        <p>She started noticing how often she waited for certain people to make her feel okay. How she
        gave their responses the power to decide her mood. How easily her peace slipped away when
        expectations weren’t met.</p>

        <p>This time, instead of blaming herself or feeling hurt, she tried something different.</p>

        <p>She stepped back.</p>

        <p>She didn’t cut people off.</p>

        <p>She didn’t become cold.</p>

        <p>She didn’t stop caring.</p>

        <p>She simply stopped chasing explanations.</p>

        <p>When someone stayed neutral, she reminded herself that neutrality wasn’t rejection. When
        someone didn’t respond the way she hoped, she resisted the urge to fill the silence with
        assumptions.</p>

        <p>It wasn’t easy.</p>

        <p>Some days, her old habits returned. She still felt disappointed. Still wished for reassurance.
        Still wanted to feel chosen.</p>

        <p>But now, she noticed those feelings without drowning in them.</p>

        <p>She began setting quiet boundaries — not with others, but within herself.</p>

        <p>She chose not to replay conversations endlessly.</p>

        <p>She chose not to measure her worth through reactions.</p>

        <p>She chose not to wait where she wasn’t invited.</p>

        <p>Slowly, her attention shifted.</p>

        <p>She noticed the love that didn’t confuse her.</p>

        <p>Her aunt’s constant care.</p>

        <p>Her best friend’s steady presence.</p>

        <p>Her boyfriend’s patient support.</p>

        <p>They didn’t make her anxious.</p>

        <p>They didn’t make her overthink.</p>

        <p>They simply stayed.</p>

        <p>For the first time, Sahana allowed herself to value that kind of love — the kind that didn’t
        require proof, explanations, or constant reassurance.</p>

        <p>She realized something important.</p>

        <p>Peace didn’t come from being chosen by everyone.</p>

        <p>It came from choosing herself when expectations began to hurt.</p>

        <p>This didn’t mean she stopped feeling.</p>

        <p>She was still emotional.</p>

        <p>Still sensitive.</p>

        <p>Still caring.</p>

        <p>But now, she was gentler with herself.</p>

        <p>She learned that not every connection needed depth. Not every relationship needed emotional
        investment. And not everyone was meant to meet her where she stood.</p>

        <p>That understanding didn’t harden her heart.</p>

        <p>It freed it.</p>

        <p>Sahana wasn’t completely healed yet.</p>

        <p>But she was no longer trapped in the same cycle.</p>

        <p>And for the first time in a long while, her mind felt lighter — not because everything was
        perfect, but because she finally knew where to stop.</p>
