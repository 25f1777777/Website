    <div class="chapter-subtitle">Love That Was Already There</div>

    <div class="story-text">

        <p>Sahana never thought she lacked love.</p>

        <p>It existed around her — quietly, steadily — without demanding attention.</p>

        <p>At home, her aunt cared for her in ways that didn’t need explanation. She noticed when Sahana
        skipped meals, when she returned home unusually silent, when her tiredness felt heavier than
        usual. She defended her without being asked and worried about her without making it obvious.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, she loved Sahana more fiercely than her own daughter.</p>

        <p>Sahana accepted that love easily — almost too easily.</p>

        <p>It was constant.</p>
        <p>Reliable.</p>
        <p>Always there.</p>

        <p>And because of that, she never questioned it.</p>

        <p>Then there was a close friend she had connected with during college — someone she mostly
        spoke to online. They hadn’t spent much time together in person, but he understood her in a
        quiet, uncomplicated way.</p>

        <p>When Sahana felt overwhelmed, he stayed.</p>

        <p>When she struggled to explain her emotions, he waited patiently.</p>

        <p>He didn’t rush her to feel better.</p>

        <p>He didn’t dismiss what she felt.</p>

        <p>He simply listened.</p>

        <p>On nights when her thoughts felt too heavy, she typed messages slowly, unsure how to explain
        herself. He read every word carefully and replied with reassurance that felt calm, not intrusive.</p>

        <p>This was love too — steady, respectful, and supportive.</p>

        <p>Her boyfriend supported her differently.</p>

        <p>He believed in her academic abilities when she doubted herself. He helped her break down
        concepts, guided her through difficult topics, and reminded her that effort mattered more than
        comparison.</p>

        <p>He didn’t pressure her.</p>
        <p>He didn’t belittle her confusion.</p>
        <p>He stood beside her patiently.</p>

        <p>Sahana never denied this love.</p>

        <p>She just didn’t notice it the way she should have.</p>

        <p>Because none of it disturbed her peace.</p>

        <p>None of it made her anxious.</p>

        <p>None of it made her overthink.</p>

        <p>None of it made her question her worth.</p>

        <p>And without realizing it, she began confusing calm with absence.</p>

        <p>She didn’t yet understand that love doesn’t always announce itself loudly. Sometimes, it stays
        so steady that it becomes invisible.</p>

        <p>For now, she lived surrounded by care — unaware that she was already holding what she would
        later search for elsewhere.</p>

        <hr style="margin:50px 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #eee;">

        <h2 class="chapter-title">CHAPTER 3 – PART II</h2>
        <div class="chapter-subtitle">What She Started Looking For</div>

        <p>Somewhere along the way, something in Sahana changed.</p>

        <p>Not suddenly.</p>
        <p>Not noticeably.</p>
        <p>But quietly.</p>

        <p>She was surrounded by people who cared for her, yet a small restlessness began to settle in her
        heart. It wasn’t loneliness. It was something harder to explain — a feeling that something was
        missing, even though nothing was gone.</p>

        <p>The love she received felt steady. Safe. Predictable.</p>

        <p>And slowly, without realizing it, she began wanting something else.</p>

        <p>She started paying more attention to how people responded to her. Who noticed her first. Who
        chose her without being asked. Who made her feel important in moments that weren’t planned.</p>

        <p>She didn’t want attention.</p>
        <p>She wanted meaning.</p>

        <p>She wanted to feel chosen — not because she was always there, but because she mattered.</p>

        <p>The problem was, she never said this out loud.</p>

        <p>Instead, she waited.</p>

        <p>She waited for people to notice her silence. To understand her moods. To read the things she
        didn’t know how to explain.</p>

        <p>When they didn’t, she told herself she was expecting too much.</p>

        <p>So she adjusted again.</p>

        <p>She gave more patience.</p>
        <p>More understanding.</p>
        <p>More space.</p>

        <p>And with every adjustment, her expectations grew quieter — but heavier.</p>

        <p>She began confusing calm love with distance. Support with indifference. Consistency with lack
        of depth.</p>

        <p>The people who stayed never made her anxious, and somehow, that made them fade into the
        background of her emotional world.</p>

        <p>What pulled her attention instead were moments that felt uncertain.</p>

        <p>A delayed response.</p>
        <p>An unclear reaction.</p>
        <p>A neutral stand during conflict.</p>

        <p>These moments stayed with her longer than they should have. They disturbed her peace. And
        strangely, that disturbance made them feel important.</p>

        <p>She didn’t recognize this pattern yet.</p>

        <p>She only knew that she was thinking more. Questioning more. Feeling more unsettled than
        before.</p>

        <p>On the bus rides home, as the city lights passed by the window, she replayed conversations in
        her mind. Not the warm ones — the confusing ones.</p>

        <p>At night, she found herself wondering where she stood in people’s lives. Whether she was
        important, or just convenient. Whether she was valued, or simply available.</p>

        <p>She didn’t blame anyone for these thoughts.</p>

        <p>She blamed herself.</p>

        <p>Maybe she was too emotional.</p>
        <p>Maybe she needed to expect less.</p>
        <p>Maybe this was just how things were.</p>

        <p>Still, the feeling didn’t leave.</p>

        <p>Sahana was slowly learning something about herself — though she didn’t know it yet.</p>

        <p>She was drawn to relationships that made her question her place, and overlooking the ones that
        never made her doubt it.</p>

        <p>This was the beginning of that shift.</p>

        <p>The moment when love stopped being something she received — and became something she
        started searching for.</p>
