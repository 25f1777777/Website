    <div class="chapter-subtitle">The Way Sahana Loved</div>

    <div class="story-text">

        <p>Sahana had always felt things more deeply than the people around her.</p>
        <p>She noticed pauses in conversations.</p>
        <p>Changes in tone.</p>
        <p>The difference between a reply that came instantly and one that came hours later.</p>
        <p>These details stayed with her long after others forgot them.</p>

        <p>People often called her emotional. She never argued with that. She knew she felt more — and
        she had learned to live with it.</p>

        <p>Sahana cared easily. When she liked someone, she remembered small details about them. When
        someone shared a problem, she carried it with her even after the conversation ended. Love, to
        her, was something you showed, not something you guarded.</p>

        <p>And because she loved deeply, she expected deeply too.</p>
        <p>Not in a demanding way.</p>
        <p>Not with words.</p>
        <p>But quietly.</p>

        <p>She expected people to notice her effort the way she noticed theirs. She expected understanding
        without having to ask for it. When those expectations weren’t met, she didn’t confront anyone.
        She adjusted herself instead.</p>

        <p>Adjustment came naturally to her.</p>

        <p>Silence felt safer than conflict. Overthinking felt easier than asking direct questions. She often
        chose to carry her hurt quietly rather than disturb the peace around her.</p>

        <p>At night, when the world slowed down, her mind didn’t.</p>

        <p>Conversations replayed themselves. Words took on new meanings. She wondered if she had
        misunderstood closeness, if she had imagined importance where there was none.</p>

        <p>Still, she believed in goodness.</p>
        <p>She believed kindness mattered.</p>
        <p>She believed effort mattered.</p>
        <p>She believed love always meant something.</p>

        <p>What she didn’t know yet was that loving without boundaries could slowly disturb her peace.</p>

        <p>For now, Sahana continued the only way she knew how —<br>
        with an open heart, quiet expectations, and a belief that love would eventually understand her.</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1 – PART II</h2>
        <div class="chapter-subtitle">Learning to Adjust</div>

        <p>Sahana didn’t learn to expect too much overnight.</p>

        <p>It happened slowly — through moments that seemed small, almost harmless.</p>

        <p>When someone interrupted her, she let them finish.</p>
        <p>When someone misunderstood her, she explained gently.</p>
        <p>When someone forgot her effort, she reminded herself that not everyone notices things the way
        she does.</p>

        <p>She became good at adjusting.</p>

        <p>Too good.</p>

        <p>If someone was upset, she apologized first — even when she wasn’t sure what she had done
        wrong. If someone pulled away, she assumed she needed to try harder. Somewhere along the
        way, she began to believe that love meant responsibility.</p>

        <p>That caring for someone meant protecting their comfort, even at the cost of her own.</p>

        <p>She rarely asked for reassurance. Instead, she waited for it. She believed that if she truly
        mattered, people would notice on their own.</p>

        <p>When they didn’t, she didn’t complain.</p>

        <p>She questioned herself instead.</p>

        <p>Maybe she was expecting too much.</p>
        <p>Maybe she was being sensitive.</p>
        <p>Maybe she needed to be quieter, calmer, easier to be around.</p>

        <p>So she became that.</p>

        <p>She learned to stay silent during misunderstandings. She learned to smile through
        disappointment. She learned to convince herself that being needed was the same as being valued.</p>

        <p>But deep inside, something always felt incomplete.</p>

        <p>She wanted to feel important without asking.</p>
        <p>She wanted to feel chosen without explaining.</p>

        <p>And because she never said these things out loud, her expectations stayed invisible — even to
        herself.</p>

        <p>This wasn’t something she recognized as a problem yet.</p>

        <p>It was just the way she had learned to love.</p>

        <p>Quietly.</p>
        <p>Carefully.</p>
        <p>And always a little too much.</p>
