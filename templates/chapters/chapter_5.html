    <div class="chapter-subtitle">When Thoughts Became Louder</div>

    <div class="story-text">

        <p>Overthinking didn’t arrive suddenly in Sahana’s life.</p>

        <p>It had always been there — quietly present — but now it began taking more space than before.</p>

        <p>Small things stayed with her longer.</p>

        <p>Moments replayed themselves again and again.</p>

        <p>Silences felt heavier than words.</p>

        <p>She found herself thinking about interactions long after they ended. A neutral reply felt
        incomplete. A calm response felt distant. Her mind searched for meaning where none was
        clearly offered.</p>

        <p>And the more she thought, the more unsettled she felt.</p>

        <p>What disturbed her the most was how easily her peace slipped away. Things that shouldn’t have
        mattered this much began affecting her entire day. A small disappointment could follow her
        from morning to night.</p>

        <p>She tried to reason with herself.</p>

        <p>She told herself she was being sensitive.</p>

        <p>That she was expecting too much.</p>

        <p>That people had different ways of caring.</p>

        <p>But logic didn’t quiet her thoughts.</p>

        <p>Her emotions didn’t respond to explanations.</p>

        <p>She became more alert, more watchful. She noticed who replied late, who stayed neutral, who
        didn’t step in when she expected them to. Each observation added another layer to her
        thoughts.</p>

        <p>Her mental space grew crowded.</p>

        <p>At night, when everything around her slowed down, her mind stayed awake. Conversations
        replayed themselves with different endings. She wondered what she could have said
        differently. What she should have done less. What she expected without realizing it.</p>

        <p>She didn’t want to be like this.</p>

        <p>She missed the version of herself that felt lighter, the one who didn’t analyze every
        interaction.</p>

        <p>But the more she tried to stop thinking, the harder it became.</p>

        <p>Overthinking didn’t just steal her sleep.</p>

        <p>It stole her calm.</p>

        <p>She began carrying emotional weight into places that once felt safe. Even ordinary days started
        feeling tiring. Not because something went wrong — but because her mind never rested.</p>

        <p>She didn’t know it yet, but this was the beginning of emotional exhaustion.</p>

        <p>Not caused by one person.</p>

        <p>Not caused by one incident.</p>

        <p>But by expectations she never spoke about — and thoughts she never let go of.</p>

        <hr style="margin:50px 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #eee;">

        <h2 class="chapter-title">CHAPTER 5 – PART II</h2>
        <div class="chapter-subtitle">Carrying Too Much</div>

        <p>Sahana didn’t notice the exhaustion at first.</p>

        <p>It didn’t come as tiredness in her body.</p>

        <p>It came as heaviness in her mind.</p>

        <p>She felt drained even on days when nothing particularly bad happened. Small interactions left
        her unsettled. Ordinary conversations stayed with her longer than they should have.</p>

        <p>She was tired of thinking — but she couldn’t stop.</p>

        <p>Her emotions began spilling into everything. A small misunderstanding could ruin her mood
        for hours. Silence felt louder than words. Neutral responses felt colder than they were meant
        to be.</p>

        <p>She cried more easily now.</p>

        <p>Not loudly.</p>

        <p>Not in front of anyone.</p>

        <p>Quietly, in moments no one saw — on bus rides home, late at night, staring at the ceiling,
        wondering why everything felt so heavy.</p>

        <p>She started questioning herself more than ever.</p>

        <p>Why am I like this?</p>

        <p>Why do I expect so much?</p>

        <p>Why does this affect me so deeply?</p>

        <p>The questions didn’t bring answers.</p>

        <p>They only brought guilt.</p>

        <p>She felt guilty for wanting reassurance.</p>

        <p>Guilty for feeling hurt when no one had promised her anything.</p>

        <p>Guilty for not appreciating the love she already had.</p>

        <p>That guilt sat beside her constantly.</p>

        <p>People around her noticed something had changed.</p>

        <p>Her aunt asked gentle questions.</p>

        <p>Her best friend stayed online longer than usual.</p>

        <p>Her boyfriend tried to reassure her, reminding her to rest.</p>

        <p>Sahana smiled and said she was fine.</p>

        <p>She always did.</p>

        <p>But inside, she felt scattered.</p>

        <p>She realized something unsettling — she was giving her emotional energy to situations that
        disturbed her peace, while taking comfort from people who never unsettled it.</p>

        <p>She was chasing clarity from places that only gave confusion.</p>

        <p>And still, she held on.</p>

        <p>She believed that if she tried a little harder, understood a little more, stayed patient a little
        longer, things would settle. That her emotions would make sense eventually.</p>

        <p>But instead of settling, they piled up.</p>

        <p>One evening, after breaking down over something that shouldn’t have hurt so much, Sahana sat
        quietly, exhausted.</p>

        <p>And for the first time, she asked herself a different question.</p>

        <p>Not why am I hurting?</p>

        <p>But why am I hurting myself like this?</p>

        <p>The question stayed.</p>

        <p>It didn’t accuse anyone else.</p>

        <p>It didn’t demand answers.</p>

        <p>It simply waited.</p>

        <p>Sahana didn’t know it yet, but this question was the beginning of change.</p>
