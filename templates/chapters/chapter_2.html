    <div class="chapter-subtitle">The Long Road Forward</div>

    <div class="story-text">

        <p>Nothing in Sahana’s life ever came easily — not because she lacked ability, but because her path
        always seemed longer than others’.</p>

        <p>When she applied for higher education and the first admission list was released, her name wasn’t
        there.</p>

        <p>She refreshed the page once.</p>
        <p>Then again.</p>
        <p>As if looking harder might change something.</p>
        <p>It didn’t.</p>

        <p>She stared at the screen for a few seconds longer than necessary, then placed her phone aside.</p>

        <p>There were no tears, no dramatic reaction — just a quiet heaviness settling in her chest.</p>

        <p>She told herself it was okay.</p>
        <p>That this wasn’t the end.</p>
        <p>That delays didn’t always mean denial.</p>

        <p>In the second counseling, she finally secured a seat in engineering. The branch wasn’t what she
        had imagined for herself, but the college was one she had quietly hoped for. That part mattered
        more than she admitted.</p>

        <p>She smiled — not out of excitement, but relief.</p>

        <p>“This is still progress,” she thought.</p>

        <p>Later, during the sliding round, her branch changed. It wasn’t a celebration, but it felt like hope
        returning gently. She didn’t announce it loudly. She carried it quietly, the way she carried most
        things.</p>

        <p>College life began before sunrise.</p>

        <p>She became a day scholar, traveling long hours every day. The bus rides were slow and crowded.
        Mornings smelled of dust and early tea. Some days she listened to music. Some days she revised
        notes. Some days she simply watched the sky change colors through the window.</p>

        <p>That seat by the window became familiar.</p>

        <p>The journey was tiring, but she rarely complained. She believed effort was something you
        accepted, not something you argued with.</p>

        <p>On her first day in the new class, she chose a seat quietly and settled in. A classmate told her she
        couldn’t sit there because she had joined late.</p>

        <p>Sahana nodded, picked up her bag, and moved.</p>

        <p>She didn’t argue.</p>
        <p>She didn’t explain.</p>
        <p>She told herself it didn’t matter.</p>

        <p>But it stayed with her longer than she admitted.</p>

        <p>Classes moved on. Lectures blurred together. Concepts demanded more effort than they seemed
        to demand from others. Sahana studied harder, revised more, and still felt like she was chasing
        something that refused to stay.</p>

        <p>Yet every morning, she showed up again.</p>
        <p>She always did.</p>

        <hr style="margin:50px 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #eee;">

        <h2 class="chapter-title">CHAPTER 2 – PART II</h2>
        <div class="chapter-subtitle">Quiet Struggles</div>

        <p>College slowly taught Sahana that effort and results didn’t always move at the same speed.</p>

        <p>She attended every class. She listened carefully. She wrote notes neatly, hoping that writing
        things down would help things stay. But memory had never been kind to her. No matter how
        much she revised, some concepts slipped away, especially the technical ones.</p>

        <p>It frustrated her more than she admitted.</p>

        <p>She didn’t lack interest.</p>
        <p>She didn’t lack effort.</p>
        <p>She lacked retention.</p>

        <p>Before exams, she stayed up late, revising again and again, convincing herself that this time it
        would be different. Sometimes it was. Often, it wasn’t.</p>

        <p>What made it harder was this — she helped others.</p>

        <p>She explained concepts patiently, breaking them down until they understood. She answered
        doubts without hesitation. Watching their faces light up gave her a quiet satisfaction.</p>

        <p>But when results came out, she often saw those same people score higher than her.</p>

        <p>She smiled for them.</p>
        <p>She congratulated them.</p>
        <p>And then she went quiet.</p>

        <p>She never resented them. But a familiar question returned again and again — why does it feel
        harder for me?</p>

        <p>Sahana didn’t talk about this much. When someone asked how she was managing, she said she
        was fine. “Just busy,” she replied.</p>

        <p>Busy became her shield.</p>

        <p>Between classes, she existed on the edges of groups — present, but never fully settled. She
        laughed when others laughed. She listened more than she spoke. She avoided drawing attention
        to herself.</p>

        <p>She didn’t want to disturb anyone.</p>
        <p>She didn’t want to be a problem.</p>

        <p>There were days when small comments stayed with her longer than they should have. A casual
        remark. A joke that wasn’t meant to hurt. Others forgot them easily. She carried them home.</p>

        <p>On the bus ride back, as the city lights blurred past the window, her thoughts grew heavier.</p>

        <p>Sometimes she rested her head against the glass, exhausted — not just physically, but mentally.</p>

        <p>Still, she found comfort in small things.</p>

        <p>Drawing helped. Lines stayed where she placed them. Colors didn’t forget themselves. Cooking
        helped too. When she cooked, people gathered. Compliments followed. For a while, she felt
        seen.</p>

        <p>These moments didn’t fix everything — but they helped her breathe.</p>
