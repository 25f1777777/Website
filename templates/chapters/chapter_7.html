    <div class="chapter-subtitle">When Expectations Fell Silent</div>

    <div class="story-text">

        <p>The change didn’t arrive as a moment.</p>

        <p>There was no argument.</p>

        <p>No confrontation.</p>

        <p>No dramatic ending.</p>

        <p>It arrived quietly — the way most real changes do.</p>

        <p>One evening, on her way back home, Sahana sat by the bus window, watching the city lights blur
        past her. The bus was crowded, noisy, moving the same way it always did. But her mind felt
        different.</p>

        <p>Still.</p>

        <p>For the first time in a long while, she wasn’t replaying conversations. She wasn’t waiting for a
        reply. She wasn’t wondering how someone felt about her.</p>

        <p>She was just there.</p>

        <p>And in that stillness, something became clear.</p>

        <p>She was tired of expecting.</p>

        <p>Tired of hoping people would respond a certain way.</p>

        <p>Tired of waiting to feel chosen.</p>

        <p>Tired of giving her peace away so easily.</p>

        <p>She thought about how much emotional energy she had invested in places that never promised
        what she wanted. And without anger or blame, she finally understood something she had
        avoided for a long time.</p>

        <p>They hadn’t failed her.</p>

        <p>She had placed expectations where there were no promises.</p>

        <p>That realization didn’t break her.</p>

        <p>It relieved her.</p>

        <p>Her thoughts moved gently to the people who had always stayed — the ones whose care never
        demanded explanation, whose presence never made her anxious, whose love never asked her
        to prove herself.</p>

        <p>She had mistaken intensity for importance.</p>

        <p>She believed love had to disturb her peace to matter. That uncertainty meant depth. That
        confusion meant connection.</p>

        <p>But real love didn’t do that.</p>

        <p>Real love felt steady.</p>

        <p>It didn’t make her question herself.</p>

        <p>It didn’t leave her restless.</p>

        <p>That night, lying in bed, Sahana didn’t try to fix herself. She didn’t promise to change overnight.
        She didn’t expect perfection.</p>

        <p>She made one quiet decision.</p>

        <p>She would stop expecting from people who never promised.</p>

        <p>She would stop craving a specific kind of love.</p>

        <p>She would start recognizing the love that already existed.</p>

        <p>The days that followed weren’t perfect.</p>

        <p>She still felt things deeply.</p>

        <p>She still cared.</p>

        <p>She still overthought sometimes.</p>

        <p>But now, she noticed when expectations began to disturb her peace — and she chose to step
        back.</p>

        <p>She learned where to pause.</p>

        <p>Where to let go.</p>

        <p>Where to stop waiting.</p>

        <p>And slowly, without forcing it, her peace returned.</p>

        <p>Not because people changed —</p>

        <p>but because she did.</p>

        <p>Sahana didn’t stop loving.</p>

        <p>She simply learned where to place her love.</p>

        <p>And that made all the difference.</p>
