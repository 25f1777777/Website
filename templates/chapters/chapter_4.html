    <h2 class="chapter-title">CHAPTER 4 – PART I</h2>
    <div class="chapter-subtitle">Eesha</div>

    <div class="story-text">

        <p>Eesha entered Sahana’s life quietly.</p>

        <p>There was no dramatic beginning. No instant bond that demanded attention. She was simply
        there — part of conversations, part of classrooms, part of everyday college life.</p>

        <p>Eesha was kind. That was the first thing Sahana noticed.</p>

        <p>Kind in a calm, uncomplicated way. She spoke softly, listened patiently, and treated everyone
        with the same warmth. She didn’t create exclusivity. She didn’t withdraw either. She existed
        comfortably among people, without needing to choose or be chosen.</p>

        <p>Sahana admired that.</p>

        <p>She admired how easily Eesha moved through friendships. How she laughed freely. How she
        spoke to everyone without hesitation. How she never seemed unsure of her place.</p>

        <p>At first, Sahana felt grateful to have someone like her around.</p>

        <p>Their conversations began casually — about classes, assignments, small college complaints.
        Eesha was easy to talk to. She responded kindly, without judgment, without probing too deeply.</p>

        <p>That should have been enough.</p>

        <p>But slowly, something shifted.</p>

        <p>Sahana began looking forward to Eesha’s presence more than she expected. She noticed when
        Eesha wasn’t around. She remembered small things Eesha said and replayed them later,
        wondering if they meant as much to Eesha as they did to her.</p>

        <p>She didn’t question it at first.</p>

        <p>She told herself this was how friendships grew.</p>

        <p>But without realizing it, expectations began to form.</p>

        <p>Not spoken.</p>
        <p>Not demanded.</p>
        <p>Just felt.</p>

        <p>Sahana wanted something she didn’t know how to ask for.</p>

        <p>She wanted to feel important.</p>

        <p>Not above others.</p>
        <p>Just… chosen.</p>

        <p>She noticed how Eesha treated everyone the same. How the same warmth was shared
        everywhere. How stories Sahana thought were personal were told again to others.</p>

        <p>That realization unsettled her.</p>

        <p>Eesha wasn’t doing anything wrong.</p>
        <p>She wasn’t unkind.</p>
        <p>She wasn’t distant.</p>
        <p>She was simply consistent.</p>

        <p>And that consistency made Sahana feel invisible.</p>

        <p>She didn’t understand why it bothered her so much. She tried to tell herself that this was
        normal, that she was overthinking again.</p>

        <p>But her heart didn’t quiet down.</p>

        <p>She began waiting — for a sign, a gesture, a moment that would make her feel different from
        the rest.</p>

        <p>Eesha, unaware of this silent shift, remained the same.</p>

        <p>And in that gap between who Eesha was and what Sahana hoped for, something fragile began
        to form.</p>

        <p>Expectation.</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">CHAPTER 4 – PART II</h2>
        <div class="chapter-subtitle">Expecting Without Asking</div>

        <p>Sahana didn’t realize when admiration turned into expectation.</p>

        <p>It happened quietly — the way most emotional shifts do.</p>

        <p>She began noticing small things more than before. How Eesha reacted in group conversations.
        Who she replied to first. Who she stood beside during disagreements.</p>

        <p>One afternoon, a discussion in class turned tense.</p>

        <p>“That’s not what I meant,” Sahana said, her voice low but steady.</p>

        <p>Someone interrupted her.</p>

        <p>Another laughed it off.</p>

        <p>The conversation moved on too quickly.</p>

        <p>Sahana didn’t argue.</p>
        <p>She didn’t repeat herself.</p>

        <p>She waited.</p>

        <p>Not for the class —</p>
        <p>for Eesha.</p>

        <p>Eesha looked between both sides for a moment, then said softly,</p>

        <p>“Let’s not make this a big issue.”</p>

        <p>And just like that, it ended.</p>

        <p>No one was wrong.</p>
        <p>No one was right.</p>

        <p>But something inside Sahana dropped.</p>

        <p>When small arguments happened, Sahana found herself waiting.</p>

        <p>Waiting for Eesha to speak.</p>
        <p>Waiting for her to take a side.</p>
        <p>Waiting for her to stand beside her — especially when Sahana knew she wasn’t wrong.</p>

        <p>But Eesha didn’t.</p>

        <p>She stayed neutral. She avoided conflict. She chose silence over involvement. Not out of
        carelessness, but because that was who she was.</p>

        <p>To Eesha, it was peace.</p>
        <p>To Sahana, it felt like distance.</p>

        <p>Whenever Sahana got upset, Eesha apologized. Even when she didn’t fully understand why
        Sahana was hurt. Even when she hadn’t done anything wrong.</p>

        <p>She lowered her self-respect quietly, hoping things would return to normal.</p>

        <p>She went back every time.</p>

        <p>Sahana noticed this — and instead of feeling reassured, she began expecting more.</p>

        <p>If Eesha cared enough to apologize, shouldn’t she also defend her?</p>

        <p>If Eesha stayed, shouldn’t she choose her sometimes?</p>

        <p>Eesha, meanwhile, remained the same with everyone. The same kindness. The same patience.
        The same openness.</p>

        <p>There were no moments that felt exclusive to Sahana.</p>

        <p>And that hurt more than she expected.</p>

        <p>She didn’t hate Eesha.</p>
        <p>She didn’t blame her.</p>

        <p>She just wanted something Eesha never promised.</p>

        <p>And because she never said this out loud, the expectations stayed hidden — growing heavier
        with time.</p>

        <p>This was the beginning of imbalance.</p>

        <p>Not because someone was unkind —</p>
        <p>but because expectations were placed where they didn’t belong.</p>
